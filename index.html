COEXTRO IS DEAD
</h1>
<p>
because of this, my web hosting is down. this page is hosted with github pages, temporarily. The regular garbage will return in "a few weeks", supposedly
</p>

<p>
my ISP is actually very good, they have the cheapest, fastest plans, it's just they broke something last week and now none of my services are online. oh well.
</p>

<p>
  i'm sure nobody will miss the never-used clubpenguin server in the meantime anyway. crafty.moe, urmom.ga, and giganig.ga will all return soonâ„¢
